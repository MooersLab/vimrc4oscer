This is Blaine's dot vimrc file that worked on the supercomputer Schooner at [OSCER](http://ou.edu/oscer) in Feburary 2020.

This computer system is Centos 7. 
You can check by entring `cat /etc/os-release`.

The vim had version 7.4.

You will have to install vundle in .vim first for the plugins to be installed in the subfolder `~/.vim/bundle`.
Otherwise comment out the lines that call the plugins.
